# File explanation for database development

## Video compression

*It was necessary for data storage and irrelevance of certain data, to crop videos to 48 hours after the contaminant exposure*

- **list_TxMfiles** : File written in 'I:\\' (NAS) to list all ToxMate files relevant to ToxPrints
- **db_dev1** : File to recreate dope reg with necessary columns for file location and thus compression
- **test_crop** : Single use of the crop function

**toxprint_cropvids** - the big bertha (crop all videos on the database to 48h post exposure)

## Creation of the database

*This relies on a pc with direct access to the NAS*
